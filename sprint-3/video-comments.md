# CHAOSS CALL 
I plan on attending the Risk Working Group call on April 20th. 

# Evolution Call Discussion Summary
In the evolution call, the participants discussed metrics and two of them which were discussed quite in depth were "Aggregators" and "Parameters". It talked about people's activity status and questioned if they were still interested in the project or leaving the community. They also discussed some redundancies in the wording of the metric as well as some spelling and other grammatical errors. I agreed with one of the participants who brought up the term "cut-offs" while talking about inactivity duration and said that some other word should be used in place of that as the word means something else and thus, could lead to some misunderstandings. The meeting ended by discussing what working group certain metric should belong to.
