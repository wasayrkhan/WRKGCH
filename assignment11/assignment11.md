Plan to attend : Risk Working Group (April 13th) 

As someone who listens to podcasts quite regularly, I was quite impressed with this one. I loved hearing about the origin and their stories. The speakers did well in explaining the metrics and how they came together to work towards a common goal. I love the concept of everyone being involved in this, no matter your qualifications.
