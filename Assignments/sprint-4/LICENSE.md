I would prefer to use the MIT software as  it allows you to share your code under a copyleft license without forcing others to expose their proprietary code. It's business friendly and open source friendly while still allowing for monetization. MIT allows you to keep your source code private so long as you give credit in the license file along with a copyright notice.
