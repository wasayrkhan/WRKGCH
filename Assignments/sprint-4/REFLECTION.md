## Reflections

I chose to use Sails for my application. I pretty much followed the steps that Dr. Goggins showed in his video and just went from there. I also found Sails to be quite simple so that played its part in helping me make my decision. I was able to successfully install Sails on my computer and my account creation was also successfull. However, I did struggle while making the application and I think I can account that to my lack of knowledge of Sails. I was googling "how to make a sails app" and just trying to figure out a way to get something worth submitting.
